#  NariEmpowered


Women empowerment is endowing women with all the rights in the society so that they can live freely without any restrictions and fear. Every woman can make a difference no matter her place in life. One way to empower women is to make them economically self-sufficient. With NaariEmpowered, women can gain access to the enchanting portal of self-sufficiency. It is a one stop solution which facilitates women to set up their business and support other such businesses. 



Taking it a step further, NaariEmpowered addresses the issue of Pink tax. Pink tax is the hidden cost that women pay for the products marketed to them in specific. Dismantling this gender-discriminatory tax is an imperative step towards achieving gender equality. Gender equality will help uplift women thereby, empowering them to voice their opinions and have a say in the decision-making process.



NaariEmpowered eliminates pink tax by making available subsidized women essentials from the proceedings we obtain through the each sale of products and contributions made towards this cause. With NaariEmpowered, empower women together.
